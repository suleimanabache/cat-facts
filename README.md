## Deploy on Vercel

I am yet to try to this but The easiest way to deploy a Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
